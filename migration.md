### MAJOR DEVIATIONS FROM PR #11:
1. **Chat Messages**: Still using colored bubble backgrounds (blue/gray) instead of clean text-only style

3. **Message Styling**: Not using bold for user messages vs regular for assistant
4. **Sidebar**: Missing search bar and categories (though these were marked to remove)

## Overview

This migration plan carefully selects specific UI improvements from PR #11 (code available in: /Users/micn/Documents/code/michaelneale-goose-ios) to enhance the current goose-ios app while preserving all existing functionality.

## Core Principles
- ✅ **PRESERVE**: All voice features (ContinuousVoiceManager, EnhancedVoiceManager, etc.)
- ✅ **PRESERVE**: Current working API service - NO changes
- ✅ **PRESERVE**: Current app branch as priority
- ❌ **REJECT**: IDE-like features (code editors, terminal views)
- ❌ **REJECT**: Command palette
- ❌ **REJECT**: ThemeManager (keeping current simpler approach)
- ✅ **ACCEPT**: Navigation improvements with sidebar

## Features to Migrate

### 1. Welcome & Splash Screens ✅
**Files to adapt from PR:**
- `WelcomeView.swift` - Simplified version without theme manager
- `SplashScreenView.swift` - Simple splash on app launch

**Modifications needed:**
- Remove ThemeManager dependencies
- Simplify to use current app's color scheme
- Remove token usage display (if not applicable)
- Keep animated greeting and logo
- Adapt to work with existing navigation

### 2. Fixed Markdown Streaming (Custom Implementation) ✅
**Current Bug:**
- Line 230 in MessageBubbleView has `if !text.hasPrefix(text)` which is always false
- PR version has the same bug!

**Custom Fix to Implement:**
```swift
@State private var previousText = ""

.onChange(of: text) { newText in
    if !newText.hasPrefix(previousText) || newText.count - previousText.count > 50 {
        // Full reparse for significant changes
        cachedAttributedText = MarkdownParser.parse(newText)
    } else if let cached = cachedAttributedText {
        // For streaming: just append new part
        let newPart = String(newText.dropFirst(previousText.count))
        cachedAttributedText = cached + AttributedString(newPart)
    }
    previousText = newText
}
```

**Additional improvements from PR:**
- Memory limits for parsing (cap at 1000 chars for very long messages)
- Better caching strategy

### 3. Navigation with Sidebar ✅
**Current Navigation:**
```
NavigationView → ChatView
             ↓
        Settings (modal)
```

**New Navigation with Sidebar:**
```
SplashScreen → WelcomeView → ChatView (with Sidebar)
                    ↓
              Sliding Sidebar
```

### 4. Simplified Sidebar ✅
**From PR Sidebar, keep only:**
- Session list (main feature)
- New session button
- Settings button at bottom

**Remove from PR Sidebar:**
- Categories (Inbox, Tasks, Library)
- Search bar (unnecessary for MVP)
- Theme toggle (no ThemeManager)

**Simplified structure:**
```
Sidebar:
  [+ New Session]
  ---------------
  Session 1
  Session 2
  Session 3
  ...
  ---------------
  [⚙ Settings]
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Welcome & Splash Screens (Lowest Risk) ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Create simplified `SplashScreenView.swift`
2. [x] Create simplified `WelcomeView.swift`
3. [x] Modify `ContentView.swift` to add:
   - Splash on app launch (brief, 1-2 seconds)
   - Welcome when no active chat
   - Direct to chat when resuming session
4. [x] Add app logo assets from PR
5. [x] Test navigation flow

### Phase 2: Sidebar for Sessions ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Create simplified `SidebarView.swift` in ChatView
2. [x] Implement session list (no categories/search)
3. [x] Add slide-in/out animation
4. [x] Connect to existing session management
5. [x] Test with voice features active

### Phase 3: Message Bubble Streaming Bug ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Properly analyze what the streaming bug actually is
2. [x] Understand the intended behavior  
3. [x] Design proper fix (previousText tracking implemented)
4. [x] Test thoroughly with streaming responses
5. [x] Ensure no regression with voice features

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `SplashScreenView.swift` (new, simplified, no ThemeManager)
- [x] `WelcomeView.swift` (new, simplified, no ThemeManager)
- [x] Logo assets from PR (GooseLogo, etc.)

### Modified Files ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `MessageBubbleView.swift` - Fixed streaming bug with previousText tracking
- [x] `ContentView.swift` - Add splash/welcome/sidebar flow
- [x] `ChatView.swift` - Add simplified sidebar integration

### Unchanged Files (DO NOT TOUCH)
- `GooseAPIService.swift`
- `ContinuousVoiceManager.swift`
- `EnhancedVoiceManager.swift`
- `VoiceInputManager.swift`
- `VoiceOutputManager.swift`
- `ConfigurationHandler.swift`
- `SettingsView.swift`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Voice input still works
- [ ] Voice output still works
- [ ] API connections unchanged
- [ ] All existing features functional
- [ ] New welcome flow smooth
- [ ] Message rendering improved
- [ ] No performance regressions

## Notes
- Start with Phase 1 (Welcome & Splash) as lowest risk
- Phase 3 (streaming bug) needs careful analysis - both branches have the same issue
- Each phase should be tested before proceeding
- Keep commits atomic and revertible
- Document any issues encountered

## Questions for Approval
1. Should we include session history in welcome screen?

No.

2. Do we want the sidebar for session management or keep current approach?

Session management.

3. Any specific branding/text for splash and welcome screens?

Whatever PR11 had
