You can use gh cli to look at https://github.com/michaelneale/goose-ios/pull/1

There are style and some functional changes I want to bring over from there:

* svg graphics and look at feel changes, subtle layout improvements
* input is better, and how it does voice needs to migrate over (but not extension or Auto button)
* How it views into tool details as a new pane is interesting and would like that

But that PR does not work, keep that in mind.
