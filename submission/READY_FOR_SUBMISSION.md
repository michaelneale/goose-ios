## What You Need to Do 📋

### Critical (Must Do)
1. **Take 3-5 screenshots** (30 minutes)
   - iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator: 1290 x 2796 px
   - Main chat, settings, voice input, tool execution
   
2. **Write App Store text** (30 minutes)
   - App name (30 chars)
   - Subtitle (30 chars) 
   - Description (explain it connects to goosed)
   - Keywords for search

3. **Fill App Store Connect metadata** (30 minutes)
   - Support URL (GitHub)
   - Review notes (explain trial mode)
   - Contact info for reviewers
   - Privacy answers (No data collection)

4. **Set to Unlisted** (1 minute)
   - App Store Connect → Pricing & Availability
   - Select "Unlisted on the App Store"
   - This gives you a direct URL to share

### Total Effort: ~90 minutes

## Unlisted vs TestFlight

| Feature | TestFlight | Unlisted App Store |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Testing | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Works |
| Duration | 90 days max | ∞ Permanent |
| Testers | 10,000 limit | ∞ Unlimited |
| Search | Not searchable | Not searchable |
| Link sharing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-updates | ✅ | ✅ |
| Distribution | Beta | Production |

**Recommendation**: Keep both active
- TestFlight for beta/testing
- Unlisted App Store for stable releases

## Approval Expectations

### Timeline
