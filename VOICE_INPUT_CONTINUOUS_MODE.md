# 🎤 Continuous Voice Input Implementation

## Overview
Modified the voice input system to support continuous transcription without auto-submission. Users can now dictate text that accumulates in the input field, and only send when they press the send button.

## Changes Made

### 1. EnhancedVoiceManager.swift ✅

#### New Callback
- Added `onTranscriptionUpdate: ((String) -> Void)?` callback
- This updates the text field in real-time without submitting

#### Modified Behavior by Mode

**Audio Mode (Continuous Transcription):**
- ✅ Transcribes speech continuously
- ✅ Updates input field in real-time via `onTranscriptionUpdate`
- ✅ Finalizes text on silence (2 second threshold)
- ✅ Plays subtle sound when text is captured
- ✅ Continues listening after each phrase
- ❌ Does NOT auto-submit messages
- 👤 User must press send button to submit

**Full Audio Mode (unchanged):**
- ✅ Transcribes speech
- ✅ Auto-submits on silence (for conversational flow)
- ✅ Speaks responses
- ✅ Returns to listening after response

**Normal Mode (unchanged):**
- ⌨️ Standard keyboard input

#### New Method: `finalizeCurrentTranscription()`
```swift
private func finalizeCurrentTranscription() {
    guard !transcribedText.isEmpty else { return }
    
    print("📝 Finalizing transcription (continuous mode): \(transcribedText)")
    
    // Update the text field with finalized text
    onTranscriptionUpdate?(transcribedText)
    
    // Play a subtle sound to indicate text was captured
    playSound(.submit)
    
    // Reset for next phrase but keep listening
    transcribedText = ""
    hasDetectedSpeech = false
    lastSpeechTime = Date()
    
    // Stay in listening state - don't restart, just continue
    print("🎤 Continuing to listen...")
}
```

#### Modified: `handleRecognitionResult()`
- In audio mode: Calls `onTranscriptionUpdate` for real-time updates
- In fullAudio mode: Still auto-submits on final result

#### Modified: `checkForSilence()`
- Audio mode: Calls `finalizeCurrentTranscription()` (no submit)
- Full Audio mode: Calls `submitTranscription()` (auto-submit)

#### Updated Description
- Audio mode description changed from "Listen only, no speech" to "Continuous transcription"

### 2. ChatView.swift ✅

#### Removed
```swift
.onChange(of: voiceManager.transcribedText) { newText in
    // Update input text with transcribed text in real-time
    if !newText.isEmpty && voiceManager.voiceMode != .normal {
        inputText = newText
    }
}
```

#### Added
```swift
// Set up transcription update callback for continuous input (audio mode)
voiceManager.onTranscriptionUpdate = { transcribedText in
    // Update the input text field without sending
    inputText = transcribedText
}
```

### 3. WelcomeView.swift ✅

Same changes as ChatView:
- Removed `.onChange(of: voiceManager.transcribedText)`
- Added `voiceManager.onTranscriptionUpdate` callback

## User Experience

### Before (Old Behavior)
1. User taps microphone to enable audio mode
2. User speaks: "Hello, I need help with..."
3. **[2 second pause]**
4. ❌ Message auto-submits immediately
5. User can't add more context or edit

### After (New Behavior)
1. User taps microphone to enable audio mode
2. User speaks: "Hello, I need help with..."
3. **[2 second pause]**
4. ✅ Text appears in input field with subtle sound
5. User can continue speaking: "...setting up my database"
6. **[2 second pause]**
7. ✅ More text added to input field
8. User reviews the text, optionally edits
9. User presses send button when ready
10. Message is sent

## Benefits

1. **More Control** - Users decide when to send
2. **Edit Before Sending** - Can review and modify transcribed text
3. **Multi-Part Messages** - Can dictate in multiple segments
4. **Reduced Errors** - Can catch transcription mistakes before sending
5. **Natural Flow** - Speak in natural pauses without triggering submission

## Testing

### Audio Mode (Continuous)
1. Enable audio mode (blue microphone icon)
2. Speak a phrase
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. ✅ Verify text appears in input field
5. ✅ Verify subtle sound plays
6. ✅ Verify microphone stays active
7. Speak another phrase
8. ✅ Verify text is appended
9. Press send button
10. ✅ Verify message is sent

### Full Audio Mode (Conversational)
1. Enable full audio mode (green microphone icon)
2. Speak a phrase
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. ✅ Verify message auto-submits (old behavior preserved)
5. ✅ Verify response is spoken
6. ✅ Verify listening resumes after response

## Files Modified

- `Goose/EnhancedVoiceManager.swift`
- `Goose/ChatView.swift`
- `Goose/WelcomeView.swift`

## Files Backed Up

- `Goose/EnhancedVoiceManager.swift.backup.before_continuous_input`
- `Goose/ChatView.swift.backup.before_continuous_input`
- `Goose/WelcomeView.swift.backup.before_continuous_input`

## Console Output

### Audio Mode
```
🔄 Voice mode changed from normal to audio
🎤 Listening...
📝 Finalizing transcription (continuous mode): Hello I need help
🎤 Continuing to listen...
📝 Finalizing transcription (continuous mode): with my database setup
🎤 Continuing to listen...
```

### Full Audio Mode
```
🔄 Voice mode changed from audio to fullAudio
🎤 Listening...
[User speaks]
🎤 Speaking response: Here's how to set up your database...
🔊 Speech synthesis finished
🎤 Restarting listening after speech
```

## Next Steps

1. Test in Xcode simulator
2. Test on real device
3. Verify both audio modes work as expected
4. Consider adding visual feedback (e.g., pulsing mic icon during continuous listening)
5. Consider adding a "Clear" button to reset transcribed text
